To get pyqt to work, I had to run the command below from the command line. I was already cd-ed into the correct folder '\WeatherApp' where my .ui file was saved. This funtion turned my .ui file from PyQT Designer into a .py file.

>>> call python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic pyqt_weather_app.ui -o pyqt_weather_app.py -x
